Project Boost - This is the first non text based game I have ever made :D

Author: Luke McCann

A Simple rocket game like that of the classic game "Thrust".

Note: 
this project does not utilise best practices. This project was built whilst getting to grips
with Unity specific methods and techniques via Udemy. 

To Play:

. Use spacebar to engage thrusters
. A and D to rotate

The aim is to find and reach the goal block indicated by the flag before
your fuel runs out!
